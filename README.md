## FAQ
1. **Will I be banned from pokemon go for using PokeNurse?**  
This app is meant to make pogo easier to manage. This is not a bot. We do not send location data. No one has ever been banned for using PokeNurse as far as we are aware. This doesn't mean you cannot be banned, if they somehow begin to detect API calls from pogobuf, then this may very well start happening, but that is the risk of using any of these third party tools right now that are not the original app.

2. **What is this `hashingKey` PokeNurse asks for?**  
The API Hashing service is a paid service that allows third party Pokémon GO developers to build awesome tools for the game. Most of this tools were free to use in the past but, because of some changes Niantic introduced, there's no way to use them anymore without a Hashing Key license. You can learn more about what they are and how much they cost [from this website](https://talk.pogodev.org/d/51-api-hashing-service-by-pokefarmer).

## Known Issues
* Google 2 Factor Authentication cannot be used. However you can use an [AppPassword](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords) instead.
